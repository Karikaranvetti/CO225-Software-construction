to connect a client client should use nc command as follows (here port number used as 2000)
nc <ip_address> 2000

Then client will be connected to the server and ask from you the username
after you enter your username they will ask your bidding item symbol untill you enter valid symbol
Next it will ask your bidding value. Here value should be in double format and it consider only as a valid bid if it is higher than current price of that item.
it will keep asking your bidding valu for that item.
