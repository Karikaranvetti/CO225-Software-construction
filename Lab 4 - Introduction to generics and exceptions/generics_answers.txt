1. Suppose the set currently have N number of elements and one wants to add another. How
many comparison operations do you need?
    N number of comparison


2. To remove an element how many operations do you need to do? Does it change with the
number of elements in the set?

    To remove the first element we need to create N-1 size new array and copying all elements with out first element. 
    then assign the new array as our data array this are the operations have to do. 
    this number of operations depends on number of elements in the array   

3. Suppose the items are kept sorted. Can you improve the performance of add? Explain.
     In my implementation it doesn't make any efficient i compared with all element in array 


4. Consider the two implementation options given for remove in the skeleton code. Which
option is better? Why?.
    option 1 is better because in option 1 if condition only do one operation but option2 its additionaly doing not operation .


5. Can you use Java annotation to get rid of -Xlint flag?
    yes we can .
